      question: >-
        How much yield do you lose because of fall armyworm? Please think back over the last 3 seasons. (Percent or bags per acre are fine.)

      title: Trade-off for 10-Day Earlier Harvest

      title: Damage Threshold to Switch Variety
      question: >-
        What level of pest or disease damage would make you stop using your current maize variety and switch to a new variety? (Give a clear threshold, e.g., % plants/ears damaged or severity.)

      title: Expectations for Replacement Variety
      question: >-
        What would you expect from a new maize variety to replace the one you currently grow? Please be as detailed as possible (e.g., DTM, FAW tolerance, drought stage tolerance, typical yield).

      title: Minimum Acceptable Harvest in Bad Year
      question: >-
        In a bad year, what is the smallest harvest you would accept and still plant this maize again next season? (Percent of usual harvest or bags per acre.)

      title: Most Damaging Drought Timing
      question: >-

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    - In English.
    - Keys exactly:
      • "analysis": short string
      • "expected_answer": short string
      • "followup_question": a single short confirm/validate question (NOT an array; may be empty string)
      • "score": integer 1–100

    FOLLOW-UP INTENT:
    - The follow-up must confirm or clarify the respondent's original answer to the SAME question.
    - Target the biggest uncertainty: missing unit/scale, missing number, time window, baseline, or method used.
    - Keep it single-scope (no multi-part), concrete, and answerable immediately.
    - Do not introduce new topics or additional objectives.
